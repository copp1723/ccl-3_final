# ccl-3-final.onrender.com Deployment Fix

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your app is deployed at: **https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com**
Current status: **Blank page due to missing environment variables**

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 1: Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS (Critical)

In your Render.com dashboard for `ccl-3-final`:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com
```

This will fix the current error:
```
Error: ‚ùå Security errors that must be fixed:
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS must be set in production
```

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 2: Set Production URLs (Recommended)

Add these for proper URL handling:

```
API_BASE_URL=https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com
CLIENT_URL=https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com
```

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 3: Verify Existing Variables

Ensure these are already set (from our previous fixes):

```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-character-hex-string>
JWT_SECRET=<32-character-hex-string>  
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<32-character-hex-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<32-character-hex-string>
```

---

## üöÄ AFTER SETTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

1. Render.com will automatically redeploy
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
3. Visit https://ccl-3-final.onrender.com
4. You should see the CCL-3 application interface

---

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED SUCCESS LOGS

After the fix, your deployment logs should show:

```
‚úÖ Email trigger rules loaded
‚úÖ Redis configuration check  
‚úÖ Health checker initialized
‚úÖ Metrics collector initialized
‚úÖ Performance monitoring started
‚úÖ CCL-3 Server started on port 10000
```
