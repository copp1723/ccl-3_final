## 🔄 Conversation Flow Example

### Typical Auto Finance Conversation

```
🤖 Agent: Hi John! I'm Sarah from Complete Car Loans. I see you're interested in auto financing. I'd love to help you find the perfect financing solution. What type of vehicle are you looking to purchase?

👤 Lead: Hi, I'm looking for an SUV, something reliable for my family.

🤖 Agent: Great choice! SUVs are perfect for families. What's your ideal price range? And are you looking to buy new or used?

👤 Lead: Probably used, around $25,000-$30,000 range.

🤖 Agent: Perfect! That's a great budget for a quality used SUV. To help me find the best financing options for you, could you tell me about your employment situation? Are you currently employed full-time?

👤 Lead: Yes, I work full-time at a marketing company, been there for 3 years.

🤖 Agent: Excellent job stability! That really helps with financing. Without getting too personal, how would you describe your credit situation? Good, fair, or something you're working on improving?

👤 Lead: I think it's pretty good, probably around 720.

🤖 Agent: Outstanding! With a 720 credit score and stable employment, you'll qualify for our best rates. Do you have any money set aside for a down payment?

👤 Lead: I can probably do $5,000 down.

🤖 Agent: Perfect! With your profile, I can already see you'd qualify for rates as low as 4.9% APR. Would you like me to connect you with one of our partner dealers who can show you some great SUVs in your price range? 

👤 Lead: Yes, that sounds great! When can we set something up?

### Concurrent Campaign Management

Each campaign runs independently with:
- **Different AI Agent personalities**
- **Unique qualification criteria** 
- **Separate handover processes**
- **Individual performance metrics**
- **Custom conversation flows**

Example configuration for multiple automotive campaigns:

```javascript
// Luxury Vehicle Campaign
const luxuryCampaign = {
  name: "Luxury Auto Financing",
  qualificationCriteria: { minScore: 80 },
  handoverCriteria: { 
    qualificationScore: 85,
    keywordTriggers: ["premium financing", "luxury dealer"]
  }
};

// First-Time Buyer Campaign  
const firstTimeCampaign = {
  name: "First-Time Auto Buyers",
  qualificationCriteria: { minScore: 60 },
  handoverCriteria: {
    qualificationScore: 70, 
    keywordTriggers: ["first car", "need help", "nervous about credit"]
  }
};

// Refinancing Campaign
const refinanceCampaign = {
  name: "Auto Loan Refinancing", 
  qualificationCriteria: { minScore: 65 },
  handoverCriteria: {
    qualificationScore: 75,
    keywordTriggers: ["lower payment", "refinance", "current loan"]
  }
};
```

## 📋 Handover Configuration

### Setting Qualification Criteria

```javascript
handoverCriteria: {
  // SCORE-BASED QUALIFICATION

  // CONVERSATION-BASED TRIGGERS
  conversationLength: 3,         // Minimum exchanges
  timeThreshold: 900,            // 15 minutes max
  
  // KEYWORD-BASED TRIGGERS (immediate handover)
  keywordTriggers: [
    "ready to apply",
    "speak to manager",
    "visit your location", 
    "urgent situation",
    "need help today"
  ],
  
  // GOAL-BASED REQUIREMENTS
  goalCompletionRequired: [
    "credit_assessment",
    "budget_confirmation", 
    "vehicle_preference"

      role: "closer",
      priority: "high",
      specialties: ["luxury_vehicles", "complex_financing"]
