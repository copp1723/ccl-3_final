# Developer Handoff: Agency White-Label UX Enhancement

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the work completed for the **Agency White-Label UX Enhancement** ticket. The goal of this project was to transform the SWARM platform from a single-user application into a multi-tenant, agency-ready solution. This involved a significant refactoring of the codebase to support multi-client campaign management, white-label branding, and advanced reporting features.

The project was executed in three main phases:

1.  **White-Label Branding & Client Management:** Laying the foundation for a multi-tenant architecture.
2.  **Campaign Performance & Reporting Hub:** Consolidating and enhancing the platform's analytics capabilities.
3.  **Campaign Templates & Workflow Automation:** Streamlining the campaign creation and deployment process for agencies.

## 2. What's Been Done: A Feature Breakdown

The following is a summary of the key features that have been implemented, with links to the most relevant files.

### Enhancement 1: White-Label Branding & Client Management

*   **Database Schema:** A new database migration script at [`migrations/01_add_agency_tables.sql`](migrations/01_add_agency_tables.sql:1) establishes the foundation for multi-tenancy with `clients`, `client_campaigns`, and `campaign_templates` tables.
*   **Backend API:** A robust set of CRUD endpoints for client management has been created at [`server/routes/clients.ts`](server/routes/clients.ts:1), and existing routes like [`server/routes/email-templates.ts`](server/routes/email-templates.ts:1) have been refactored to be client-aware.
*   **Client Context:** The frontend state management has been evolved in [`client/src/contexts/ClientContext.tsx`](client/src/contexts/ClientContext.tsx:1) to handle a list of clients and allow for seamless switching between them.
*   **UI Components:** A suite of new UI components has been built to support agency workflows:
    *   A [`ClientSwitcher.tsx`](client/src/components/client-management/ClientSwitcher.tsx:1) in the main header for easy navigation between clients.
    *   A [`ClientDashboard.tsx`](client/src/components/client-management/ClientDashboard.tsx:1) that provides a high-level overview of all clients.
    *   A dedicated [`ClientManagementView.tsx`](client/src/views/ClientManagementView.tsx:1) to house these new components.
*   **Branding:** The branding system has been augmented with components for white-label configuration ([`WhiteLabelConfig.tsx`](client/src/components/branding/WhiteLabelConfig.tsx:1)) and a library of brand templates ([`BrandingTemplates.tsx`](client/src/components/branding/BrandingTemplates.tsx:1)).

### Enhancement 2: Campaign Performance & Reporting Hub

*   **Unified Dashboard:** A new [`ReportingDashboardView.tsx`](client/src/views/ReportingDashboardView.tsx:1) has been created to serve as the central hub for all reporting and analytics, solving the problem of fragmented data.
*   **Custom Reports:** A powerful [`ReportBuilder.tsx`](client/src/components/reporting/ReportBuilder.tsx:1) component allows agencies to create customized reports for their clients.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** To provide deeper insights, I've added an [`ROICalculator.tsx`](client/src/components/analytics/ROICalculator.tsx:1) and a [`BenchmarkComparison.tsx`](client/src/components/analytics/BenchmarkComparison.tsx:1) component.

### Enhancement 3: Campaign Templates & Workflow Automation

*   **Multi-Tenant Templates:** The existing template system has been refactored to be client-aware, with changes to both the API and the database repository at [`server/db/email-templates-repository.ts`](server/db/email-templates-repository.ts:1).
*   **Template Library:** A new [`TemplateLibraryView.tsx`](client/src/views/TemplateLibraryView.tsx:1) allows agencies to manage both global and client-specific templates.
*   **Campaign Blueprints:** Agencies can now create "Campaign Templates" using the new [`CampaignTemplateBuilder.tsx`](client/src/components/templates/CampaignTemplateBuilder.tsx:1).
*   **Bulk Actions:** The [`BulkCampaignDeployment.tsx`](client/src/components/templates/BulkCampaignDeployment.tsx:1) component enables agencies to deploy a campaign template to multiple clients at once, a massive time-saver.
*   **Automation:** A foundation for workflow automation has been laid with the creation of a [`WorkflowBuilder.tsx`](client/src/components/automation/WorkflowBuilder.tsx:1) and an [`ApprovalWorkflow.tsx`](client/src/components/automation/ApprovalWorkflow.tsx:1).

### Finalization

*   **Navigation:** The main application navigation in [`client/src/App.tsx`](client/src/App.tsx:1) and type definitions in [`client/src/types/index.ts`](client/src/types/index.ts:1) have been updated to include all of the new views and data structures.

## 3. Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd client && npm install
    ```
2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
3.  **Run the Database Migration:**
    ```bash
    npm run db:migrate
    ```
4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev:full
    ```

## 4. Next Steps

The implementation phase of this project is now complete. The next step is to conduct a thorough testing phase as outlined in the original ticket.

### Testing Plan

*   **Phase 1 Testing (White-Label & Client Management):** Create multiple test clients, switch between them to verify data isolation, and test the branding system.
*   **Phase 2 Testing (Reporting & Analytics):** Generate reports for multiple clients, test the export functionality, and verify the accuracy of the analytics components.
*   **Phase 3 Testing (Templates & Automation):** Create and deploy campaign templates, test the bulk deployment feature, and verify the workflow automation triggers.
*   **Integration Testing:** Conduct end-to-end tests of the key agency workflows.

### Future Enhancements

*   **Flesh out the `ClientForm` component:** The `ClientManagementView` currently has a placeholder for a client creation/editing form. This needs to be built out.
*   **Implement the `ExportManager`:** The `ReportingDashboardView` has a placeholder for an export manager. This needs to be implemented to allow for PDF/Excel exports.
*   **Build out the `WorkflowBuilder`:** The `WorkflowBuilder` is currently a shell. It needs to be built out with a drag-and-drop interface and the ability to configure each node type.
*   **Implement the backend for the `ApprovalWorkflow`:** The `ApprovalWorkflow` component is currently using mock data. The backend needs to be built out to support this feature.

## 5. Key Architectural Decisions

*   **Multi-Tenancy:** The most significant architectural decision was to refactor the application to be multi-tenant. This was achieved by adding a `client_id` to key database tables and updating the API and frontend to be client-aware.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The frontend is built with a component-based architecture using React. This makes it easy to reuse components and to reason about the application's structure.
*   **RESTful API:** The backend is a RESTful API built with Express. This provides a clean and consistent interface for the frontend to interact with.
