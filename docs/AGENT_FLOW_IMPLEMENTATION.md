# CCL-3 SWARM Agent Communication Flow - Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

The agent communication flow has been successfully connected! When leads arrive (via Boberdoo API or CSV import), they are now automatically processed by the multi-agent system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Lead Processing Pipeline** (`server/index.ts`)
- Added `processNewLead()` function that orchestrates the entire agent workflow
- When a lead arrives, it triggers:
  1. Overlord Agent evaluation and routing decision
  2. Channel-specific agent message generation
  3. Actual message sending (Email/SMS)
  4. Conversation and communication tracking
  5. Real-time WebSocket updates
  6. Qualification score updates

### 2. **Import Route Enhancement** (`server/routes/import.ts`)
- CSV imports now trigger full agent processing
- Each imported lead gets:
  - Overlord routing decision
  - Initial contact message generated
  - Message sent via appropriate channel
  - Full conversation tracking

### 3. **Webhook Handlers** (`server/routes/communications.ts`)
- Added dedicated Mailgun webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/mailgun`)
- Added dedicated Twilio webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/twilio`)
- Both webhooks:
  - Find the lead by email/phone
  - Save incoming messages as conversations
  - Trigger agent response generation
  - Send automated replies
  - Update qualification scores

### 4. **WebSocket Enhancements**
- New message types for real-time updates:
  - `lead_processed`: Notifies when a lead is processed
  - `lead_sent_to_boberdoo`: Updates when lead is sold
  - `lead_processing_error`: Error notifications
- Manual lead processing trigger via WebSocket

## How It Works

### Lead Arrival Flow
```
1. Lead arrives (Boberdoo API or CSV Import)
   â†“
2. Saved to database
   â†“
3. processNewLead() triggered automatically
   â†“
4. Overlord Agent evaluates lead
   â†“
5. Decision: Assign to channel (email/sms/chat)
   â†“
6. Channel agent generates personalized message
   â†“
7. Message sent via Mailgun/Twilio
   â†“
8. Conversation tracked in database
   â†“
9. WebSocket broadcasts updates to UI
   â†“
10. Qualification score updated
```

### Conversation Flow
```
1. Customer replies (email/SMS)
   â†“
2. Webhook receives message
   â†“
3. Message saved as inbound conversation
   â†“
4. Agent processes and generates response
   â†“
5. Response sent automatically
   â†“
6. Qualification score increases
   â†“
7. Process continues until qualified
```

## Testing the System

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Import Test Leads
Use the UI to import the `test_import_leads.csv` file, or create a lead via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/leads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "source": "test",
    "campaign": "summer-promo"
  }'
```

### 3. Check the Logs
You should see:
```
ðŸŽ¯ Processing new lead: abc123 - John Doe
ðŸ§  Overlord decision for John Doe: { action: 'assign_channel', ... }
ðŸ“§ Email sent to john@example.com
```

### 4. Verify in Database
- Check `agent_decisions` table for routing decisions
- Check `conversations` table for generated messages
- Check `communications` table for sent emails/SMS

## Configuration Required

### Email (Mailgun)
```env
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-api-key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@your-domain.com
```

### SMS (Twilio)
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### AI (OpenRouter)
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Webhook Configuration

### Mailgun
Configure webhook URL in Mailgun dashboard:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/mailgun
```

### Twilio
Configure webhook URL in Twilio phone number settings:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/twilio
```

## What Happens Now?

1. **Leads are automatically processed** - No more sitting idle in the database!
2. **Emails and SMS are sent** - Real communications via Mailgun and Twilio
3. **Conversations build naturally** - Agents respond to customer replies
4. **Qualification scores update** - Based on engagement and responses
5. **Boberdoo submission** - When leads reach qualification threshold

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tune agent personalities** - Adjust prompts in each agent file
2. **Set up campaigns** - Define goals and qualification criteria
3. **Monitor conversations** - Use the UI to watch agents in action
4. **Adjust qualification thresholds** - Based on your business needs

## Troubleshooting

### No messages being sent?
- Check API keys in `.env` file
- Verify Mailgun/Twilio accounts are active
- Check server logs for errors

### Agents not responding to webhooks?
- Ensure webhook URLs are configured correctly
- Check that lead email/phone matches exactly
- Verify webhook endpoints are accessible

### Lead not being processed?
- Check WebSocket connection in browser console
- Verify processNewLead is being called
- Check for errors in agent decision making

## Success Metrics

You'll know the system is working when:
- âœ… Leads show "assigned_channel" in database
- âœ… Conversations appear for each lead
- âœ… Communications show "sent" status
- âœ… Qualification scores increase over time
- âœ… WebSocket updates appear in UI

The multi-agent system is now alive and actively engaging with your leads! ðŸš€
