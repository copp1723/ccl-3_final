## API Endpoints

### Manual Handover Trigger
```bash
POST /api/handover/trigger
```
**Body:**
```json
{
  "conversationId": "conversation_id",
  "reason": "Manual handover requested",
  "humanAgentId": "agent_id" // optional
}
```

### Handover Evaluation (Preview)
```bash
GET /api/handover/evaluate/{conversationId}
```

### Dossier Preview
```bash
GET /api/handover/dossier/preview/{leadId}
```

### Email Preview
```bash
GET /api/handover/dossier/email-preview/{leadId}
```

### Cross-Channel Context
```bash
GET /api/handover/context/{leadId}
```

### Test Workflow
```bash
POST /api/handover/test/{leadId}
```
**Body:**
```json
{
  "simulateHighScore": true // optional
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. **Automatic Handover Integration**

The handover system integrates automatically with existing AI agent workflows. When agents determine handover criteria are met:

```typescript
// In your agent code
const evaluation = await HandoverService.evaluateHandover(conversationId);

if (evaluation.shouldHandover) {
  await HandoverService.executeHandover(
    conversationId,
    evaluation.reason
  );
}
```

### 2. **Manual Handover Dashboard**

Frontend components can trigger manual handovers:

```typescript
const triggerHandover = async (conversationId: string, reason: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/handover/trigger', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ conversationId, reason })
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### 3. **Dossier Preview for Managers**

Supervisors can preview dossiers before handover:

```typescript
const previewDossier = async (leadId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/handover/dossier/preview/${leadId}`);
  const { dossier, formattedDossier } = await response.json();
  return formattedDossier;
};
```

## Configuration

### Campaign Handover Criteria

Configure handover triggers in campaign settings:

```typescript
const handoverCriteria = {
  qualificationScore: 7,        // Minimum qualification score
  conversationLength: 5,        // Maximum message count
  keywordTriggers: [           // Trigger phrases
    'ready to buy',
    'interested',
    'when can we meet'
  ],
  timeThreshold: 300,          // Max conversation duration (seconds)
  goalCompletionRequired: [    // Required completed goals
    'Convert lead to customer'
  ],
  handoverRecipients: [        // Notification recipients
    {
      email: 'sales@company.com',
      name: 'Sales Team',
      role: 'Sales Representative',
      priority: 'high'
    }
  ]
};
```
