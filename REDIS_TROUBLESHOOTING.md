# Redis Connection Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
Your Redis URL `redis://red-d1lvtlqdbo4c73aeem10:6379` seems incomplete or incorrect.

## How to Get the Correct Redis URL from Render

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**
2. **Click on your Redis service** (ccl-3-redis or similar)
3. **Look for the "Connect" section**
4. You should see two connection strings:
   - **Internal Connection String**: Use this for services within Render
   - **External Connection String**: Use this for external connections

## Expected URL Formats

### Internal (for services on Render):
```
redis://red-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:6379
```
or with authentication:
```
redis://:password@red-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:6379
```

### External (for local development):
```
rediss://red-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.oregon-postgres.render.com:6379
```

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Disable Redis Temporarily
Add this to your Render environment variables:
```
ENABLE_REDIS=false
```

### Option 2: Use the Correct Internal URL
1. Get the correct URL from your Redis service page
2. Update the REDIS_URL environment variable in Render

### Option 3: Check if Redis Service is Running
Make sure your Redis service is:
- Created and deployed
- In the same region as your web service
- Not suspended or stopped

## Testing Redis Connection Locally

If you want to test with the external URL locally:
```bash
# Install redis-cli if you don't have it
brew install redis  # on macOS

# Test connection
redis-cli -u "your-redis-url" ping
```

## Alternative: Run Without Redis
CCL-3 can operate without Redis with reduced functionality:
- No caching
- No rate limiting with persistence
- Sessions stored in memory only

To run without Redis, the app will automatically fall back to memory-only mode.
